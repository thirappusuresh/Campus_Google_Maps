"Version-1" is for getting the directions from our campus website but the name of source/destination to which we want route plans must be same as the one which is already there in Google Maps, if we fail to do so then it won't understand what is that source/destination and report Unknown address. But this is not the case in "Version-2", in this version it goes through the Google Maps official site to get the directions. In this case even-though the name of the address is not same as in the Google Maps, it shows the list of address which matches with the address string provided by us, so that we can choose the right name of source/destination address.
